## Response
I will try to be vague about this situation as it is quite personal (I couldn't think of anything else to write about) but a couple of years ago I was going through something, but one of the parties involved who had much higher authority than I did discussed my personal situation with outside parties not involved in said situation. These outside parties do not have direct relationships with me, but are connected indirectly. There was no "resolution" to this problem as the events had already passed, but I am not entirely sure what the effects were as I do not know what been said and to t. 
I'm not entirely sure what ethical theory would apply to my situation. It is not consequentialism, as the "consequences" did not justify the means. I believe that the mentioned involved party had used consequentialism as the basis for their actions.
