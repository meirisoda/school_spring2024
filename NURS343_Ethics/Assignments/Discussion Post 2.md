## Response
I will try to be vague about this situation as it is quite personal (I couldn't think of anything else to write about) but a couple of years ago I was going through something, but one of the parties involved who had much higher authority than I did discussed my personal situation with outside parties not involved in said situation. These outside parties do not have direct relationships with me, but are connected indirectly. There was no "resolution" to this problem as the events had already passed, but I am not sure what the effects were as I do not know what been said and to what extent. 
I'm not entirely sure what ethical theory would apply to my situation. It is not consequentialism, as the "consequences" did not justify the means. I believe that the mentioned involved party had used consequentialism as the basis for their actions. Because it ended up technically ending in the way that they wanted it to, whatever happened in the middle was justifiable. My own actions during that time were not justifiable either, and I also do not know what ethical theory to apply in my case as well. Although when criticizing my actions, the theory of deontology/kantianism can be applied. Any sort of ends or desire for a result does not justify the means, and all actions must be judged for its own action. 
I definitely have my own bias with this because I was personally involved. 

## Other Student's Post
I had a DNR patient waiting on hospice consult, who was on our unit over the holidays and had been delayed getting the consult. On day three, the patient was unresponsive and the nurse reached out to the PA taking care of the patient to discuss goals of care/ask for the PA to discuss DNR-CC status with the patient's family. The PA blew off the nurse's note, stating they had already discussed with the previous shift nurse with no elaboration whatsoever. The same occurred when the Respiratory Therapist raised the same concerns for the patient's status to the PA. The nurse escalated the situation and brought the attending to bedside, who concluded they should reach out to the family for a DNR-CC consideration. The patient was switched to comfort care but the PA also input a full set of labs, which the nurse argued was not necessary for a comfort care patient and was ultimately not performed. The nurse then took four hours to set up a PCA pump and I was forced to watch as the patient passed crying in pain and discomfort the same shift. The only comfort I could find was that the patient had passed with her family  surrounding her.

Having officially learned healthcare ethics, I feel severe discomfort about all parts of how this situation played out. I felt the patient fell through several failures in our care to not be able to pass away peacefully in a dignified manner. Ideally, the patient should have gone home under hospice care and died in their home with their family. If this was not possible, they should have been kept comfortable until they passed within our facility. However, none of those things occurred. All parts of our healthcare team failed to adequately support this patient and I still feel horrible for this patient. I stayed overtime for a 16 hour shift in order to prepare them to go down to the morgue, as I wanted to accompany their last moments at least as I felt that I had also failed this patient.

Under the scope of Principlism, this case would be unfit to meet the four criteria of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. In terms of autonomy, the patient had stated already that the patient wanted to pass away peacefully, which was the original reason the hospice consult had been put in. The patient should have been adequately supported until hospice consult could weigh-in, which damaged the patient's right to autonomy. The care team failed to exercise beneficence in the same way, failing to adequately support patient to keep them comfortable The criteria of justice was failed as the care team was failing to treat each other with respect. The only criteria I could argue for in this situation may be non-maleficence, as I try to believe that there was no ill will embodied by anyone in this situation.
### My response
I'm so sorry that happened, it sounds so horrible. Unfortunately I have seen this kind of thing happen so often in hospitals,  
It's clear you've been deeply affected by this patient's experience, and it's no wonder why. Your care and concern for the patient's well-being and dignity really come through in your description.

The breakdown in communication and decision-making you described sadly happens too often in healthcare settings. Teamwork and clear communication are so important, especially in cases where a patient's wishes and comfort are at stake.

Your analysis using Principlism shows a lot of thoughtfulness. It's important to recognize where the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice weren't fully followed, as this can help improve care in the future.

Despite the challenges, your commitment to being there for the patient's final moments shows your compassion and dedication to your work. Reflecting on this experience can help you grow as a healthcare professional, ensuring that in future situations, patients receive the best care possible.
