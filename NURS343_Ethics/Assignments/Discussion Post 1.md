## Prompt 
Following the first day of class, please reflect on the following and make your initial post about 400-600 words:

1. What is the difference between morality and ethics? Is this new to you? Do you believe that these definitions might have new meaning in your life or career as a nurse after contemplating the differences in definitions?
2. What is moral pluralism? What does it mean to healthcare that we live in a morally pluralistic society? Give one example from T. Engelhardt's video lecture that made an impression on you. 
2. Can you identify moral friends vs moral strangers in your life? How do you distinguish one from the other?

**After posting your answers, please respond to at least one other classmate's post. Always be courteous and respectful!  Please keep your response to around 150-200 words.**

**In order to make this discussion successful, everyone will need to post their own written piece first and early to have time to respond adequately! You will not be able to see anyone else's post until you post your own.**

Have a great week!
## Response
The difference between morality and ethics lies in what it is relative to. Morals are relative to the person, your self, and ethics are relative to the society or discipline that it applies to. Discussing the difference between morals and ethics are not very new to me, as we've learned this in my time in OR and also with personal research. Even though I am familiar with these terms and the differences between the two, the significance of morality and ethics still play a large role in my daily life. It affects a lot of the decisions and interactions that we make in our daily lives. 

Moral pluralism states that although there may be many conflicting ideas, they are all equally valid. This is similar to *religious pluralism*, which states that many religions can co-exist in the same society with equal value and be true simultaneously. Moral pluralism, or pluralism in general, is important to any group because it provides different perspectives and ideas from different people. People are organic and, no matter how hard a society tries, will always differ in many different ways. 
Somebody who was raised in a more Western, Christian background will have different views than somebody who was raised with a more Eastern background. Culture plays a much larger role on morals than one may initially anticipate. 
This is especially true in a healthcare setting, as providers are treating the whole of a population. As a population is diverse and are not monocultural (or in this case, monomoralistic(?)), it is important to consider all possibilities of personal morals and ethics. A provider from a western background will place a lot of importance on personal decision-making regarding their care (ie. that the patient's decision is the most important) and will respect the patient's decisions without question. But a provider from an eastern background may be more sensitive to the input of those surrounding the patient. 

Something that Engelhardt brings up that I found very interesting is the difference between moral pluralism and moral relativism. Prior to watching this lecture, I was not aware that there were such terms. Moral relativism is more focused on the idea that there are different moral standards and that not one is superior to the other. It encourages people to think about the way that they think or act around those that have different morals than themselves, and serves as guidance in these situations. Moral pluralism is more of the idea that different morals coexist and are capable of existing in a society. I found a couple of good journals exploring the role that moral relativism plays in our daily lives as well as the different sorts of moral relativism (descriptive, meta-ethical etc.), of which I will be reading in some time. 

I believe I can identify moral friends and strangers in my life. Although morals can be shaped by the environment one is raised in, and those around me were raised in very similar environments, there is a difference in perception and understanding that change our morals. Although the general structure may be the same, little detail
