Following the first day of class, please reflect on the following and make your initial post about 400-600 words:

1. What is the difference between morality and ethics? Is this new to you? Do you believe that these definitions might have new meaning in your life or career as a nurse after contemplating the differences in definitions?

2. What is moral pluralism? What does it mean to healthcare that we live in a morally pluralistic society? Give one example from T. Engelhardt's video lecture that made an impression on you. 

2. Can you identify moral friends vs moral strangers in your life? How do you distinguish one from the other?

**After posting your answers, please respond to at least one other classmate's post. Always be courteous and respectful!  Please keep your response to around 150-200 words.**

**In order to make this discussion successful, everyone will need to post their own written piece first and early to have time to respond adequately! You will not be able to see anyone else's post until you post your own.**

Have a great week!
