# Prompt 
Following the first day of class, please reflect on the following and make your initial post about 400-600 words:

1. What is the difference between morality and ethics? Is this new to you? Do you believe that these definitions might have new meaning in your life or career as a nurse after contemplating the differences in definitions?
2. What is moral pluralism? What does it mean to healthcare that we live in a morally pluralistic society? Give one example from T. Engelhardt's video lecture that made an impression on you. 
2. Can you identify moral friends vs moral strangers in your life? How do you distinguish one from the other?

**After posting your answers, please respond to at least one other classmate's post. Always be courteous and respectful!  Please keep your response to around 150-200 words.**

**In order to make this discussion successful, everyone will need to post their own written piece first and early to have time to respond adequately! You will not be able to see anyone else's post until you post your own.**

The difference between morality and ethics lies in what it is relative to. Morals are relative to the person, your self, and ethics are relative to the society or discipline that it applies to. Discussing the difference between morals and ethics are not very new to me, as we've learned this in my time in OR and also with personal research. Even though I am familiar with these terms and the differences between the two, the significance of morality and ethics still play a large role in my daily life. It affects a lot of the decisions and interactions that we make in our daily lives. 

Moral pluralism states that although there may be many conflicting ideas, they are all equally valid. This is similar to *religious pluralism*, which states that many religions can co-exist in the same society with equal value and be true simultaneously. Moral pluralism, or pluralism in general, is important to any group because it provides different perspectives and ideas from different people. People are organic and, no matter how hard a society tries, will always differ in many different ways. 
Somebody who was raised in a more Western, Christian background will have different views than somebody who was raised with a more Eastern background. Culture plays a much larger role on morals than one may initially anticipate. 
This is especially true in a healthcare setting, as providers are treating the whole of a population. As a population is diverse and are not monocultural (or in this case, monomoralistic(?)), it is important to consider all possibilities of personal morals and ethics. A provider from a western background will place a lot of importance on personal decision-making regarding their care (ie. that the patient's decision is the most important) and will respect the patient's decisions without question. But a provider from an eastern background may be more sensitive to the input of those surrounding the patient. 

Something that Engelhardt brings up that I found very interesting is the difference between moral pluralism and moral relativism. Prior to watching this lecture, I was not aware that there were such terms. Moral relativism is more focused on the idea that there are different moral standards and that not one is superior to the other. It encourages people to think about the way that they think or act around those that have different morals than themselves, and serves as guidance in these situations. Moral pluralism is more of the idea that different morals coexist and are capable of existing in a society. I found a couple of good journals exploring the role that moral relativism plays in our daily lives as well as the different sorts of moral relativism (descriptive, meta-ethical etc.), of which I will be reading in some time. 

I believe I can identify moral friends and strangers in my life. Although morals can be shaped by the environment one is raised in, and those around me were raised in very similar environments, there is a difference in perception and understanding that change our morals. Although the general structure may be the same, little details here and there differ and compound to eventually make me and that other person moral strangers.

When I first think about the difference between morality and ethics, I think about one’s own beliefs versus society’s beliefs. Morality is the opinion that we bring into any situation that personal experiences or our upbringings may have influenced. On the other hand, ethics are the standards that society presents us with. For example, these may be the written expectations and standards for the hospital that we are working in after we graduate. These may differ for each of our jobs but we are expected to follow these standards. This is not new to me, but I have never thought about the difference between the two concepts in depth before beginning this class. I do believe that these definitions might have a new meaning in my career as a nurse by causing me to question what is morally right versus what is ethically right. I now better understand that ethics are the rules that my workplace will present to me to follow while morality is my own beliefs that I will bring into practice to become a better nurse. However, utilizing both of these concepts will help me provide the best care possible.

Moral pluralism is when more than one value or belief may be taken into consideration, and both are relevant and respected in a conversation. When we say that we live in a morally pluralistic society, we will be presented with many different viewpoints and opinions in our lives, especially in healthcare that may be difficult to accept. However, as healthcare workers, we have to understand that everyone comes from a different background and their opinions are still important although they may differ. Engelhardt’s video, impacted me when he spoke about imagining a dispute about what the best country in the world was: Illinois or Singapore. The response to this dispute will differ by each person who answers the questions based on their experiences and upbringing.  Each person asked will have a different view on the proper liberties, equalities, prosperities, and insecurities a society should live by. Your priorities will change based on your background. I experienced this when I spent the summer in hospitals in a foreign country. My beliefs and priorities were very different from the population that I was caring for as well as the healthcare workers. I had to put my own beliefs aside and follow what was deemed right in their society.

When I think of moral friends versus moral strangers in my life, I think of the people that I like to surround myself with. While it is important to be exposed to multiple beliefs, moral friends will often share the same beliefs with you or have similar values. Moral strangers can be distinguished from moral friends in my life from our interactions. When speaking with moral strangers, I may have more difficulty conversing when our beliefs differ. A conversation with moral friends who share the same values with you may be easier.

Hey Abby! (This is not about the content of your response, but your reply in the discussion is white and cannot be read without highlighting it!) ![[Pasted image 20240206140633.png]]
I agree that the answers to questions that we, as Americans, think are very obvious end up becoming quite nuanced when you take into account different backgrounds and different morals. It's also important to consider that even those from similar general backgrounds can have differences, so we must not assume their perspective by our own judgement. I think it's really cool that you were able to be in a healthcare setting in another country. I do believe that gaining as much experience outside of America can really help nurses do better at their jobs, as it widens our perspectives and changes the point we relate from. I also agree that it is quite difficult to speak with moral strangers, because the very foundations that we base our perceptions of what is right and wrong change. Discussion is always great, but with every sensitive topic ()
