This is a two-part project in lieu of class:
1. FIRST: Find an article in a newspaper, blog, current you-tube video, magazine, or other current literature/media regarding **ethics in healthcare.**     Read and thoroughly consider the subject matter.

2. NEXT: Find a nurse, other healthcare provider, employer, preceptor, etc. with whom to discuss your selected literature or media findings. Ask their opinion on the matter before you tell them yours. This only has to take 10 min or so. Take some notes. Write the date, time, initials, and occupation of the person with whom you discussed the matter. Do NOT identify the individual.

THEN: 
1. Post a link to the article/media or upload a pdf of it to the provided Canvas discussion board.
2. **Create a header with the title of your article in BOLD**. Post your reaction to the article/media on the Discussion board. Note the ethical principle/theory/or dilemma involved and your viewpoint.
3. **Create a new header titled _Subject Interview and Discussion._** Write your notes and the date, time, initials, and occupation of the person with whom you discussed the matter. Were there any insights that were brought up by the individual with whom you discussed the matter? What did you learn from this discussion that you otherwise might not have thought of? 
4. Write a total of about 600 -700 words. Writing can be casual but professional.
5. After posting your viewpoint, please respond to _**two**_ _**_(2) o_ther classmate's**_ post with a courteous and respectful agreement or disagreement. Please keep your responses to around 150-200 words.
