This is a two-part project in lieu of class:
1. FIRST: Find an article in a newspaper, blog, current you-tube video, magazine, or other current literature/media regarding **ethics in healthcare.**     Read and thoroughly consider the subject matter.

2. NEXT: Find a nurse, other healthcare provider, employer, preceptor, etc. with whom to discuss your selected literature or media findings. Ask their opinion on the matter before you tell them yours. This only has to take 10 min or so. Take some notes. Write the date, time, initials, and occupation of the person with whom you discussed the matter. Do NOT identify the individual.

THEN: 
1. Post a link to the article/media or upload a pdf of it to the provided Canvas discussion board.
2. **Create a header with the title of your article in BOLD**. Post your reaction to the article/media on the Discussion board. Note the ethical principle/theory/or dilemma involved and your viewpoint.
3. **Create a new header titled _Subject Interview and Discussion._** Write your notes and the date, time, initials, and occupation of the person with whom you discussed the matter. Were there any insights that were brought up by the individual with whom you discussed the matter? What did you learn from this discussion that you otherwise might not have thought of? 
4. Write a total of about 600 -700 words. Writing can be casual but professional.
5. After posting your viewpoint, please respond to _**two**_ _**_(2) o_ther classmate's**_ post with a courteous and respectful agreement or disagreement. Please keep your responses to around 150-200 words.

### Exploring Neuralink: Unveiling Ethical Issues Surrounding Brain Implants
I've been quite interested in Neuralink since it's announcement, and I believe that it is especially more relevant now as it has begun its first human trial earlier this month. BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces) have always been like science fiction to me. While non-invasive BCI devices have stood clinical trials for a very long time, none had been approved by the FDA, which makes Neuralink a very significant jump in BCI commercialization and development. Another reason is obviously because of Elon Musk and his significance in technological development in the online and physical world. I've seen many opinions online regarding Neuralink since its announcement and when the human trial began. I chose this article as a good jumpstart to a conversation for those who were unfamiliar to Neuralink and the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I wanted to take the Neuralink and apply discussion to the broader technology of brain computer interfaces. 
When people are presented with the idea of an implantable chip in your brain that can control your body and outside devices, there are typically two reactions: wonder and concern. 
One is wonder at the possibility of how these devices can positively impact peoples' lives. Both invasive and non-invasive devices have been used in therapeutic contexts for long periods of time, and there is no mistaking that they save lives (think pacemakers, deep brain stimulators, prosthetics etc.). The study, as written in their brochure, is looking for quadriplegics who have lost their bodily function due to spinal cord injury or ALS. What Neuralink is trying to do is to give paraplegics their bodily autonomy back (in various ways, as stated on their website). 
The second (and more popular reaction) is concern. Aside from Neuralink and healthcare, the usage of BCIs can be more broadly applied. Some other fields that nonmedical brain-computer interfaces are making their way into are gaming, virtual reality, artistic performance and the military. 
There are several ethical issues specifically surrounding the military
