# Article Notes
Common differences between morals and ethics are: 
1. Consistency
	1. Since one's moral beliefs are personal and are ever-changing (like you!), it is not consistent across neither time nor discipline. 
	2. Ethics, on the other hand, as they are built as a system, remain consistent and may only change with any sort of policy change. 
2. Decision-Making
	1. Both affect decision-making processes. 
3. Governing Behaviours
	1. As mentioned above, morality is governed by personal beliefs, interactions and experiences. 
	2. Ethics are governed by the society and context in which they lie.
