Branch of philosophy used to study ideal human behavior and ways of being. 
Approaches have varied over time. 
**Aristotle** believes that ideal behaviors are practices leading to the end goal of [[Eudaimonia]]. 
**Immanuel Kant** believed that ideal behavior is acting in accordance with one's duty. 
	Well-being means having the freedom to exercise autonomy (self-determination), not being used as a means to an end, being treated with dignity, and having the capability to think rationally.
