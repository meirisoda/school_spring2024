Futile treatments are treatments a healthcare provider, when using good clinical judgment, does not believe will provide a beneficial outcome for a patient. 
These treatments may actually induce more harm unto patients. 

Healthcare professionals are not ethically bound to deliver futile treatments. 
## Rule of Double Effect
>[!definition]
>A set of criteria used to determine the ethics of a decision that involves weighing the benefit of an action with its possible negative but foreseeable consequences or effects. 
>The action is only considered ethical if the action (in and of itself) is moral, the actor intends *only* the positive outcome, or the good outcome greatly outweighs the possible negatives. 

The terms *killing* and *letting die* raise issues of legality, ethics, homicide, suicide, euthanasia, acts of commission and omission, and active-passive distinctions, which are beyond the scope of this chapter LMAO
