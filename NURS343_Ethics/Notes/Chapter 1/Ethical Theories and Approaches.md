## Western Ethics
Typically includes the monotheistic Western religious traditions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. 
Morality is based on sacred texts. 
Today, the line between sacred and secular text is blurred, however, this must be understood as in a post-Enlightenment world, **ethics falls under the umbrella or philosophy rather than religion**. 
### Virtue Ethics
*Watch your thoughts; they become words.
Watch your words; they become actions.
Watch your actions; they become habits.
Watch your habits; they become character.
Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.*
>[!definition]
>An approach to ethics concerned with *being* good and having moral character rather than *doing* good and following rules or focusing on duties.
>The normative question should be "How should I be?" rather than "What should I do?"

Emphasizes the role of one's character and the virtues that one's character embodies in order to determine and evaluate ethical behavior. 
Example: the purpose of a knife is to cut, so a knife that has a sharp and cuts very well exhibits virtue in excellence. 
#### Virtues
>[!definition]
>Excellent character traits that persons develop through consistently good habits or education. 
### Natural Law Theory
Different from divine command theroy in that according to divine command theory, an action is good because a divine being (such as God) commands it, whereras with natural law theory, a divine being commands an action because it is moral agnostic of divine being. 
### Deontology
>[!definition]
>The study of duty.
>An approach to ethics focused on duties and rules. 

- Also known as Kantianism. 
- The ends do not justify the means. Only through dutiful actions can people be moral. Regardless of the consequences of said actions, good actions always denote morality. 
### Consequentialism
Contrary to deontology, consequentialists consider consequences to be an important indication of the moral value of one's actions. 
## Eastern Ethics
In both Western and Eastern ethics, ethics is often intertwined with spiritual or religious thinking. However, from a traditional Eastern ethics perspective, societal and spiritual philosophies and beliefs are essentially seamless. 
They may be spiritual, but are not necessarily religious in nature.
