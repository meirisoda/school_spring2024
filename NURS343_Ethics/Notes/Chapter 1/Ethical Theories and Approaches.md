## Western Ethics
Typically includes the monotheistic Western religious traditions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. 
Morality is based on sacred texts. 
Today, the line between sacred and secular text is blurred, however, this must be understood as in a post-Enlightenment world, **ethics falls under the umbrella or philosophy rather than religion**. 
### Virtue Ethics
*Watch your thoughts; they become words.
Watch your words; they become actions.
Watch your actions; they become habits.
Watch your habits; they become character.
Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.*
