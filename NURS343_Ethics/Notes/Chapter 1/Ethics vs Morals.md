## Ethics
Branch of philosophy used to study ideal human behavior and ways of being. 
Approaches have varied over time. 
**Aristotle** believes that ideal behaviors are practices leading to the end goal of [[Eudaimonia]]. 
**Immanuel Kant** believed that ideal behavior is acting in accordance with one's duty. 
	Well-being means having the freedom to exercise autonomy (self-determination), not being used as a means to an end, being treated with dignity, and having the capability to think rationally.

Ethics is the systematic approach to understanding, analyzing and distinguishing matters of right and wrong, good and bad, and admirable and dishonorable as they relate to the well-being of and the relationships among sentient beings. 

Need to support beliefs and assertions with **sound reasoning** rather than strong opinions. 

Allowing emotions to play a large role does not provide a good foundation for ethical decisions. 
Making good rational decisions require a balance of emotion and reason. 
## Morals
