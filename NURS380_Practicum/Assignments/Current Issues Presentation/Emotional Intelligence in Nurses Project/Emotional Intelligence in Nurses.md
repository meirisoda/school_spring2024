## Definition and Why it’s Important in Nursing (Jamie)

There are four aspects to emotional intelligence: 

So how self-awareness affects our nursing care
### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness allows the nurse to identify their personal strengths and weaknesses to be comfortable with emotional discomfort.

> For example, if a nurse with a high level of emotional intelligence were to have differences in opinions with another nurse - she will recognize that these differences are not personal.
> 
> It also means that a nurse is aware of their current emotional state (if they are distressed), and is aware of how their behaviour will be affected in that current state. 
> 
> It sounds very easy to do and very logical, but most people, not just nurses will find this to be the most difficult part of EI.

### Self-Regulation

The ability to control your behavior and manage your thoughts and emotions. 

> The reason this is important for nurses is because we have to maintain a level head and make rational decisions. We shouldn’t verbally attack our patients or coworkers, make rushed or emotional decisions, stereotype people or compromise their values. 

### Social Awareness/empathy

Allows a nurse to put themselves in another’s shoes. 

> This is important because when a nurse demonstrates empathy, they do not react to “emotional outbursts” in other people, they instead take a step back and listen. They are able to work in the context of understanding others in light of what others are experiencing. 
> 
> On the flip side, when nurses empathize too much with their patients or coworkers, they can develop what is called “compassion fatigue”. This occurs when nurses become ‘closed off’  in order to protect themselves from what others are experiencing. 

### Relationship Management

Nurses who seek to have good relationships with others exhibit higher levels of emotional intelligence

> Good relations must be intentional and not expected to organically happen. Nurses must seek to engage with others, not merely tolerate others. Engagement fosters communication and gives the opportunity to practice self-evaluation and self-regulation. When nurses engage with others, they are able to empathize as needed with others. Not engaging with others does not develop relationships and necessary social skills to be emotionally intelligent. 
> 
> Often times you will hear “I just have to work with them, I don’t have to like them or socialize with them”, which may seem as though one has a high level of emotional intelligence. They recognize that they don’t really like that co-worker and puts down a boundary. While this may be true on some level, in order to give collaborative and patient-centered care, one must develop some sort of positive relationship with their co-workers and patients. 

This is where EI comes into play and why it is so important for nurses. 
### Communication

Communication is the largest and most vital piece of social skills and relationship management.

Effective communicators not only place active listening as a priority
but also exude warmth when talking with others. Warmth is felt by
others when the communicator is friendly, approachable and is kind. One has to make sure that their verbal language as well as their non-verbal language are parallel. 
Assuming yourself as 'friendly' and saying the right words, but showing impatience or condescending behaviors while talking, dismisses the receiver from hearing the friendly words.
