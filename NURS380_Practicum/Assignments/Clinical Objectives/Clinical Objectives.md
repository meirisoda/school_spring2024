1. Within the first 4 weeks of practicum, I will develop a time management strategy to get assessments done and documented on 2 patients within the first 2 hours with minimal guidance from my preceptor. 
2. By the end of my practicum experience I will be able to verbalize and discuss 3-4 commonly used medications based on the patient population of the floor including the mechanism of action, intended therapeutic use and response, common side effects and adverse drug reactions with minimal assistance needed from my assigned preceptor.
3. By the end of my practicum experience I will be able to prioritize patient care and develop an appropriate plan of care for 2-3 patients based on their assessment findings, labs, diagnostics and medications with minimal assistance needed from my assigned preceptor.
