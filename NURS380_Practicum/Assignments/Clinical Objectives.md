### Jamie Lee_Draft of Clinical Objectives
1. Within the first 4 weeks of practicum, I will develop a time management strategy to get morning assessments done and documented on 2 patients within the first 2 hours with minimal guidance from my preceptor. 
2. By the middle of my clinical experience, I will be able to verbalize and teach back 2 commonly seen diagnoses (chronic disease processes) and explain the pathophysiology, commonly seen symptoms and alterations and briefly go over interventions. 
3. By the end of my clinical experience, I will be able to verbalize and teach back 3 medications commonly given on my unit (digestive health), including (but not limited to) reason for use, administration routes, therapeutic windows, and mechanism of actions. 
4. By the end of my clinical experience, I will have developed thorough care plans for 2 patients using resources available to me such as Lippincott, Elsevier and my textbook. These care plans will include my own physical assessments and findings, their diagnoses and lab results and medications.
