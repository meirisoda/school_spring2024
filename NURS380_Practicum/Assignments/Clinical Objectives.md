### Jamie Lee_Draft of Clinical Objectives
1. Within the first 4 weeks of practicum, I will develop a time management strategy to get assessments done and documented on 2 patients within the first 2 hours with minimal guidance from my preceptor. 
2. By the middle of my clinical experience, I will be able to verbalize and teach back 2 commonly seen diagnoses (chronic disease processes) and explain the pathophysiology, commonly seen symptoms and alterations and briefly go over interventions. 
3. By the end of my clinical experience, I will be able to verbalize and teach back 3 medications commonly given on my unit (digestive health), including (but not limited to) reason for use, administration routes, therapeutic windows, and mechanism of actions. 
2. By the end of my practicum experience I will be able to prioritize patient care and develop an appropriate plan of care for 2-3 patients based on their assessment findings, labs, diagnostics and medications with minimal assistance needed from my assigned preceptor.


1. Within the first 4 weeks of my practicum experience I will develop a tool to improve time management skills so I can accurately assess and document per hospital policy on 1-2 patients in a timely manner (1-2 hours of start of shift) with minimal assistance needed from my preceptor. Confidence is too hard to measure you need to be specific what will you be able to do that would indicate this is happening ...... 2. By the end of my practicum experience I will be able to prioritize patient care and develop an appropriate plan of care for 2-3 patients based on their assessment findings, labs, diagnostics and medications with minimal assistance needed from my assigned preceptor. 3. By the end of my practicum experience I will be able to verbalize and discuss 3-4 commonly used medications based on the patient population of the floor including the mechanism of action, intended therapeutic use and response, common side effects and adverse drug reactions with minimal assistance needed from my assigned preceptor. If you have questions let me know, otherwise revise and repost here and I will review and update your score before you post to the final objective assignment link. Thank you, Dr. McConnell
