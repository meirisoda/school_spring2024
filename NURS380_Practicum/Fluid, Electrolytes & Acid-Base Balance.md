Doing this for like the fifth fucking time
## Fluid Distribution
| Intracellular | Extracellular |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Potassium     | Sodium              |
| Phosphate     | Chloride              |
| Sulfate              | Bicarb               |
## Fluid Types & Shifts
### Hypertonic
**Type** - Higher solute concentration than another solution. 
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts into higher solute solution/area 
> 3% saline
> D10
### Hypotonic
**Type** - Lower solute concentration than another solution.
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts from low solute solution to higher solute solution
> 0.45% NS
> dextrose solutions
### Isotonic 
Type - Has the same sollute concentration as another solution
