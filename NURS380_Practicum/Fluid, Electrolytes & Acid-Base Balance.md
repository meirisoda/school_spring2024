## Fluid Types & Shifts
### Hypertonic
**Type** - Higher solute concentration than another solution. 
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts into higher solute solution/area 
> 3% saline
> D10
### Hypotonic
**Type** - Lower solute concentration than another solution.
**Shits **
### Isotonic 
Has the same sollute concentration as another solution
