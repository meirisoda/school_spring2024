Doing this for like the fifth fucking time
## Fluid Distribution
| Intracellular | Extracellular |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Potassium     | Sodium              |
| Phosphate     | Chloride              |
| Sulfate              | Bicarb               |
## Fluid Types & Shifts
### Hypertonic
**Type** - Higher solute concentration than another solution. 
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts into higher solute solution/area 
> 3% saline
> D10
### Hypotonic
**Type** - Lower solute concentration than another solution.
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts from low solute solution to higher solute solution
> 0.45% NS
> dextrose solutions
### Isotonic 
**Type** - Has the same solute concentration as another solution
**Shifts** - No net change in fluid movement
> 0.9% NS
> LR
> D5W
> 5% dextrose in 0.2% saline

## Fluid Movement
### Diffusion
Movement of molecules from area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
### Osmosis 
Movement through a semipermeable membrane
### Active Transport
Energy used to move molecules from lesser concentration to higher concentration
### Filtration
Transfer of water and dissolved substances through a permeable membrane from high pressure to low pressure 
## Regulation (RAAS)
Renal Regulation
**Nephron function**
- Filters blood plasma
- Reabsorbs water and solutes as needed
- Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance
GFR 

## Assessments
### Intake and Output
| Adult | Pediatrics |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 30ml/hr | Infants - 0.5ml/kg/hr |  |
|  | Children - 1ml/kg/hr |  |
#### Pediatrics
**100/50/20 rule**
4/2/1 Formula 

4ml/kg/hr for the first 10 kg
2ml/kg/hr for the second 10 kg
1ml/kg/hr for remaining weight
### Influencing Factors
Weight
Intake and Output/Nutritional Status
## Fluid Labs
### Serum Osmolarity/Osmolality
>[!values]
>275 - 300 mOsm/L
>270 - 290 mOsm/L (pediatric)

Measures difference solutes in plasma
Primarily determined by sodium, glucose and urea
### Specific Gravity
>[!values]
>1.010 - 1.025

Measure of concentration of particles in urine and density of urine compared to water
Fair estimate of function of kidneys

| Decreased specific gravity | Increased Specific Gravity |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
|                 caused by Excessive fluid intake, diabetes insipidous           |         caused by SIADH, CHF                    |
### BUN & Creatinine
>[!values]
>**BUN:** 6-20 mg/dL
>**Creatinine:** 0.6-1.2 mg/dL (M), 0.5-1.1 mg/dL (W)


Used to determine kidney function
Measures blood, urea and nitrogen
Creatinine - breakdown product of muscle metabolism // best indicator of kidney function
### GFR 
>[!values]
>greater than 90 (adult)
>40-60 (newborn)


Glomular filtration rate
Measure of flow rate filtered fluid through the glomeruli in kidney
Can measure CKD stages 
## Volume 
### Volume Excess
>[!tx]
>fluid restriction
>diuretics
>dialysis (ultra filitration)
>positioning
>thoracentesis or paraccentesis (if ECF)
### Volume Depletion
>[!sx]
>change in mental status
tachycardia 
low BP

>[!tx]
>administer fluids

# Fluid Maintenance & Replacement
## Crystalloids
>[!definition]
>Mainly used to increase intravascular volume. 
>Solutions with small molecules that flow easily from the bloodstream into cells and tissues 
### Isotonic
0.9% NaCl and LR (has more electrolytes than NS)
### Hypotonic 
- contains less solute
- helpful for intracellular dehydration
- Provide free water and sodium and chloride
- Good for hypernatremia or decreased renal function
0.45% NaCl
### Hypertonic fluids
- contain a lot of solute (such as dextrose, sodium, chloride etc.)
- Will cause fluid overload
3% NaCl
## Colloids
>[!definition]
>Plasma expanders - they pull blood into the bloodstream.
>Thicker fluids as they contain particles too large to pass through membranes, so they will stay in intracellular space. 
>Will **maintain** circulating blood volume and keep fluid in the vessels. 

ie. dextran, hetastarch, 5% albumin, 25% albumin

## Nursing Responsibilities
w- Know your orders!! 
- Be aware of fluid overload signs and symptoms
	- If you suspect overload, stop the fluids immediately and let the provider know. 
- Monitor intake and output as well as electrolytes
