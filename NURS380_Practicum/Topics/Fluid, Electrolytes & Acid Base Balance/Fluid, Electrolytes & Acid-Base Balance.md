**Shifts** - No net change in fluid movement
> 0.9% NS
> LR
> D5W
> 5% dextrose in 0.2% saline

## Fluid Movement
### Diffusion
Movement of molecules from area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
### Osmosis 
Movement through a semipermeable membrane
### Active Transport
Energy used to move molecules from lesser concentration to higher concentration
### Filtration
Transfer of water and dissolved substances through a permeable membrane from high pressure to low pressure 
## Regulation (RAAS)
Renal Regulation
**Nephron function**
- Filters blood plasma
- Reabsorbs water and solutes as needed
- Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance
GFR 

## Assessments
### Intake and Output
| Adult | Pediatrics |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 30ml/hr | Infants - 0.5ml/kg/hr |  |
|  | Children - 1ml/kg/hr |  |
#### Pediatrics
**100/50/20 rule**
4/2/1 Formula 

4ml/kg/hr for the first 10 kg
2ml/kg/hr for the second 10 kg
1ml/kg/hr for remaining weight
### Influencing Factors

Intake and Output/Nutritional Status
## Fluid Labs
### Serum Osmolarity/Osmolality
>[!values]
>275 - 300 mOsm/L
>270 - 290 mOsm/L (pediatric)

Measures difference solutes in plasma
Primarily determined by sodium, glucose and urea
### Specific Gravity
>[!values]
>1.010 - 1.025

Measure of concentration of particles in urine and density of urine compared to water
Fair estimate of function of kidneys

| Decreased specific gravity | Increased Specific Gravity |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
|                 caused by Excessive fluid intake, diabetes insipidous           |         caused by SIADH, CHF                    |
### BUN & Creatinine
>[!values]
>**BUN:** 6-20 mg/dL
>**Creatinine:** 0.6-1.2 mg/dL (M), 0.5-1.1 mg/dL (W)


Used to determine kidney function
Measures blood, urea and nitrogen
Creatinine - breakdown product of muscle metabolism // best indicator of kidney function
### GFR 
>[!values]

Measure of flow rate filtered fluid through the glomeruli in kidney
Can measure CKD stages

# Fluid Maintenance & Replacement
## Crystalloids
>[!definition]
>Mainly used to increase intravascular volume. 
>Solutions with small molecules that flow easily from the bloodstream into cells and tissues 
### Isotonic
0.9% NaCl and LR (has more electrolytes than NS)
### Hypotonic 
- contains less solute
- helpful for intracellular dehydration
- Provide free water and sodium and chloride
- Good for hypernatremia or decreased renal function
0.45% NaCl
### Hypertonic fluids
- contain a lot of solute (such as dextrose, sodium, chloride etc.)
- Will cause fluid overload
3% NaCl
## Colloids
>[!definition]
>Plasma expanders - they pull blood into the bloodstream.
>Thicker fluids as they contain particles too large to pass through membranes, so they will stay in intracellular space. 
>Will **maintain** circulating blood volume and keep fluid in the vessels. 

ie. dextran, hetastarch, 5% albumin, 25% albumin

## Nursing Responsibilities
w- Know your orders!! 
- Be aware of fluid overload signs and symptoms
	- If you suspect overload, stop the fluids immediately and let the provider know. 
- Monitor intake and output as well as electrolytes
# Blood Transfusions
## RBCs
- Restore or maintain oxygen carrying capacity, correct anemia, increase RBC mass
- Make sure blood is compatible with other medications (typically given with NS)
- Make sure blood is within 30m~1hr of coming from blood bank
- Typically hang for 3 hours 
- Monitor for transfusion reactions ($\pm$ 1 degree Celsius)
## Platelets
- Treat bleeding, improve platelet counts pre-op
- ABO compatibility same as RBCs (RH negative should receive RRh negative products)
- Take baseline labs (PT/INR and platelet count)
- Requires special filtered tubing (which usually comes from the blood bank anyways)
- In the case of a patient who has a historrry of platelet reaction, administer slowly and administer antipiuretics or antihistamines
## Fresh Frozen Plasma
- Treat postop hemorrhage, correct coagulation factor deficiency and prepare coumadin reversal agent
- ABO compatibility **required**, Rh match not required 
- It not compatible, may cause hypocalcemia!! 
## Cryoprecipitate
- Treat factor VIII deficiency and fibrinogen disorders, hemophilia A
- ABO compatibility required, Rh match not required

# Acid/Base Balance
|           | Acidotic | Normal    | Alkalosis |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| pH        | <7.35    | 7.35-7.45 | >7.45     |
| $CO_{2}$  | >45      | 35-45     | <35       |
| $HCO_{3}$ | <22      | 22-26     | >26       |
1. Check the pH 
	1. Determine if acidotic or alkalotic.
2. Determine the $PaCO_{2}$
	1. Provides information about the respiratory component of acid-base balance
3. Determine the $HCO_{2}$ 
	1. Provides information about the metabolic aspect of acid-base balance
4. ROME (Respiratory Opposite, Metabolic Equal)
	1. $\uparrow CO_{2}$ and $\downarrow pH$ = respiratory acidosis
	2. $\downarrow CO_{2}$ and $\uparrow pH$ = respiratory alkalosis
	3. $\downarrow HCO_{3}$ and $pH$ = metabolic acidosis
	4. $\uparrow HCO_{3}$ and $pH$ = metabolic alkalosis
5. Compensation
	1. Uncompensated would be if one is different
	2. Partially compensated would be if they are all in the same direction
	3. Fully compensated would be if one is pH is normal
