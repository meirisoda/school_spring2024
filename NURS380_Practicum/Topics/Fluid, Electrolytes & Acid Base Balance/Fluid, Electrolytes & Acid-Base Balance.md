Doing this for like the fifth fucking time
## Fluid Distribution
| Intracellular | Extracellular |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Potassium     | Sodium              |
| Phosphate     | Chloride              |
| Sulfate              | Bicarb               |
## Fluid Types & Shifts
### Hypertonic
**Type** - Higher solute concentration than another solution. 
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts into higher solute solution/area 
> 3% saline
> D10
### Hypotonic
**Type** - Lower solute concentration than another solution.
**Shifts** - Fluid shifts from low solute solution to higher solute solution
> 0.45% NS
> dextrose solutions
### Isotonic 
**Type** - Has the same solute concentration as another solution
**Shifts** - No net change in fluid movement
> 0.9% NS
> LR
> D5W
> 5% dextrose in 0.2% saline

## Fluid Movement
### Diffusion
Movement of molecules from area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
### Osmosis 
Movement through a semipermeable membrane
### Active Transport
Energy used to move molecules from lesser concentration to higher concentration
### Filtration
Transfer of water and dissolved substances through a permeable membrane from high pressure to low pressure 
## Regulation (RAAS)
Renal Regulation
**Nephron function**
- Filters blood plasma
- Reabsorbs water and solutes as needed
- Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance

## Assessments
### Intake and Output
| Adult | Pediatrics |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 30ml/hr |  |  |
|  | Infants - 0.5ml/kg/hr |  |
|  | Children - 1ml/kg/hr |  |
100/50/20 rule
4/2/1 Formula 

4ml/kg/hr for the first 10 kg
2ml/kg/hr for the second 10 kg
1ml/kg/hr for remaining weight
### Influencing Factors
Weight
Intake and Output/Nutritional Status
## Fluid Labs
### Serum Osmolarity/Osmolality
>[!values]
>275 - 300 mOsm/L
>270 - 290 mOsm/L (pediatric)

Measures difference solutes in plasma
Primarily determined by sodium, glucose and urea
### Specific Gravity
>[!values]
>1.010 - 1.025

Measure of concentration of particles in urine and density of urine compared to water
Fair estimate of function of kidneys
| Decreased specific gravity | Increased Specific Gravity |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
|                 caused by Excessive fluid intake, diabetes insipidous           |         caused by SIADH, CHF                    |

### BUN & Creatinine
Used to determine kidney function
Measures blood, urea and nitrogen
Creatinine - breakdown product of muscle metabolism // best indicator of kidney function
### GFR 
Glomular filtration rate
Measure of flow rate filtered fluid through the glomeruli in kidney
Can measure CKD stages
