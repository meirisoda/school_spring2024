| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|        | 100-160 bpm     | - normal <br>- one P wave before each QRS complex        | 12-20ms            | 6-10ms            |
## Premature Atrial Contraction (PAC)
![[Pasted image 20240215162657.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| single beat | Of underlying rhythm | - premature<br>- abnormal in size, shape and direction | Of underlying rhythm | - Premature<br>- normal duration (6-10ms) |
>[!cause]
>- Triggered by atrial myocardium not originating in the SA node
>- Can also be caused by $\beta$-agonists, digoxin, tricyclics, and potentially $\beta$-blockers
>- CAD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
>- Increased risk in px w/ MI, CHF, DM, COPD

>[!tx]
>- $\beta$-adrenergic blockers
>- Type IA, IC, III anti-arrythmic agents
## Atrial Flutter
![[Pasted image 20240218224039.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Regular or irregular (depends on AV conduction ratios) | - **Atrial Rate**: 250-400bpm<br>- **Ventricular Rate**: less (counting QRS complexes) | Sawtooth waves ("flutter waves") on baseline | Not measurable | Normal |
>[!path]
>Originates in the right atria

>[!cause]
>- HF, Cardiac ischemia, myopathy
>- Surgery
>- Excessive drinking and stimulants

>[!tx]
>- $\beta$-blockers
>- cardioversion
## Ventricular Tachycardia
![[Pasted image 20240218224945.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Regular or slightly irregular | 140-250bpm (135-155 if vtach w/ pulse) | None | Not measurable | Wide (>12ms) |
>[!path]
>**Very dangerous**
>Coordinated ventricular contractions are replaced by very rapid but ineffective contractions $\rightarrow$ decreased ventricular filling $\rightarrow$ dramatic decrease in CO $\rightarrow$ absent pulse $\rightarrow$ leads to decreased oxygenation
>also AV dissociation

>[!cause]
>- Cardiac scarring
>- Too many PVCs
>- Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia)
>- Cardiomyopathy
>- SWAN placement, post CABG

>[!tx]
>Cardioversion if pulseless
>IV vasopressors & antiarrythmics (such as amiodarone)
## Atrial Fibrillation
![[Pasted image 20240219000413.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Irregular | - **Atrial Rate**: ~400bpm<br>- **Ventricular Rate**: Varies, but less than atrial rate | Irregular wave deflections on baseline | Not measurable | Normal |
>[!path]
>Abnormal electrical activity within the atria (irregular) $\rightarrow$ leads to turbulent and abnormal flow of blood through heart $\rightarrow$ decreased effeciveness in pumping blood & increased thrombus formation

>[!cause]
>- **atrial** ischemia
>- inflammation
>- chronic alcohol and drug use
>- **Risk Factors**: age, HTN, congenital heart disease

>[!sx]
>- SOB and lightheadedness
>- diaphoresis
>- palpitations and tachycardia

>[!tx]
>- control the rate (using CCBs or $\beta$-blockers)
>- anticoagulation
>- if unstable afib, cardioversion
>- if episodic and tachycardic, amiodarone (not first line)
## Ventricular Fibrillation
![[Pasted image 20240219000913.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240219001018.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Irregular | Not measurable (anywhere between 150 and 500) | Absent | Not measurable | Absent |
>[!path]
>When ventricular myocardium depolarizes erratically

>[!cause]
>- **Myocardial Ischemia**
>- Cardiac myopathy
>- Electrolyte imbalances (hyper and hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
>- Electricution accidents
>- Actual physical injury to the heart
>Can occur spontaneously or** preceded by PVCs**

>[!tx]
>CPR
>defribrilation (if no effect, administer epinephrine and amiodarone)
## Asystole
![[Pasted image 20240219002927.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| If P waves are present, will have atrial rhythm | None | Will either have a P wave with no associated QRS complex or a straight one | Not measurable | Absent |
>[tx]
>CPR
>Epinephrine (check if fine vfib)
## Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)
![[Pasted image 20240219003148.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Not a rhythm, but a single beat | Underyling rhythm | None associated with PVC | Underlying rhythm | Premature and wide (>12ms) |
>[!cause]
>Heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibers rather than the SA node
>MI, HF
>Hypoxia
>Tobacco and caffeine
>Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia

>[!sx]
>Usually asymptomatic but can include vagal sx

>[!tx]
>If asymptomatic, usually no need for treatment
>If frequent and symptomatic, antiarrhythmics and $\beta$-blockers, and CCBs
## Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia (PAT)/Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)
![[Pasted image 20240219151550.png]]

| Rhythm | Rate | P Waves | PR Interval | QRS Complex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Regular | 140-250bpm | Abnormal (usually pointed), can be hidden in preceding T wave | Usually not measurable | Normal |
>[!path]
>Results from an electrolyte imbalance after an action potential. 
>Error occurs by a calcium influx (origins from another action potential) which causes depolarization. 
>If significant enough, another AP will occur.

>[!cause]
>- CHF
>- tobacco/alcohol
>- adenosine

>[!tx]
>First step is to determine hemodynamic stability. 
>**Stable**
>- IV $\beta$-blockers or CCBs

>**Unstable**
