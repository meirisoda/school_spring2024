Related to a deficiency or excess of the hormone _vasopressin_ (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]). Diabetes insipidus occurs with ADH deficiency, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs with ADH excess.
## Pathophysiology

>[!definition]
>**Diabetes insipidus (DI)** is a water metabolism problem caused by an ADH deficiency (either a decrease in ADH synthesis or an inability of the kidneys to respond to ADH). ADH deficiency results in the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Without ADH, distal kidney tubules and collecting ducts do not reabsorb water, leading to **polyuria** (excessive water loss through urination) and dehydration.

Dehydration caused by this massive water loss $\big\uparrow$ plasma osmolarity, increasing thirst. Thirst promotes increased fluid intake and aids in maintaining water homeostasis.

## Pharmacology
### **Desmopressin** (DDAVP, Rhinal Tube, Minirin, Stimate)  
Tablets: 0.1-0.2 mg orally twice daily  
Nasal spray: 10-20 mcg every 8-12 hr  
Parenteral: 1-2 mcg IV or subcutaneously every 12 hr
> The drug is a synthetic type of ADH that serves as a replacement. It binds to kidney receptors and enhances the reabsorption of water, thus reducing urine output.

| Interventions | Rationales |
| ---- | ---- |
| Teach the patient using the inhaled form of the drug to blow the nose before taking the drug. | Drug is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Nasal secretions can dilute the drug and inhibit its absorption. |
| Teach the patient using the inhaled form to sit upright and hold his or her breath when spraying or using the rhinal tube. | Sitting upright and holding the breath keeps the drug in contact with the nasal mucosa, rather than going down the throat, enhancing drug absorption. |
| Warn the patient not to drink more than 3 L of fluids daily while on this drug. | Drug promotes fluid retention and can lead to fluid overload. |
| Teach the patient to weigh himself or herself daily and to notify the health care provider if 2 lbs or more is gained in 24 hours. | A rapid increase in weight is an indicator of excessive fluid retention and may require a change in drug dosage. |
| Tell the patient to notify the health care provider if he or she experiences a persistent headache or acute confusion. | These are manifestations of water toxicity, which must be treated before seizure activity occurs. |
### Vasopressin
5-10 units parenterally, 2-4 times daily
> The drug is an exogenous form of ADH that serves as a replacement. It binds to kidney receptors and enhances the reabsorption of water, thus reducing urine output.

| Interventions | Rationales |
| ---- | ---- |
| For the hospitalized patient, monitor for signs of water intoxication, such as listlessness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, anuria, and weight gain. | Vasopressin-induced water intoxication can also lead to seizures, coma, and death. |
| Warn the patient not to drink more than 3 L of fluids daily while on this drug. | Drug promotes fluid retention and can lead to fluid overload. |
| Teach the patient to weigh himself or herself daily and to notify the health care provider if 2 lbs or more is gained in 24 hours. | A rapid increase in weight is an indicator of excessive fluid retention and may require a change in drug dosage. |
| Tell the patient to notify the health care provider if he or she experiences a persistent headache or acute confusion. | These are manifestations of water toxicity, which must be treated before seizure activity occurs. |
### Chlorpropamide 
2250-500mg orally daily
> The drug is an antidiabetic agent that also has some antidiuretic activity through an unknown mechanism. It decreases urine output.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ask whether the patient has any allergies to sulfa-based drugs.                                              | Drug contains sulfa, and a person who is hypersensitive to sulfa drugs is likely to also be hypersensitive to this drug.                           |
| Teach patients the manifestations of hypoglycemia and to always carry candy or concentrated sugar with them. | The main action of the drug is to lower blood glucose levels. When taken by a person whose blood glucose level is normal, hypoglycemia can result. |
