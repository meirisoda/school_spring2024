Ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, is a common cause for hospital admissions. 
>[!definition]
>**Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** develops when there is an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. This is most common in individuals with type 1 diabetes but can occur in those with type 2 diabetes as well.[60,172-174]
>

In addition, a syndrome called _ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD)_ has been described in which affected individuals do not fit into the traditional ADA categories for diabetes and are more likely to be persons of African, African American, or Hispanic origin.[175] 

The most common precipitating factor for DKA is intercurrent illness, such as infection, trauma, surgery, or myocardial infarction. 
Interruption of insulin administration also may result in DKA. 
The frequency of DKA peaks in adolescence.

## Pathophysiology
In a state of relative insulin deficiency there is an increase in insulin counterregulatory hormones including catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, and GH. 
Profound insulin deficiency results in decreased glucose uptake, increased fat mobilization with release of fatty acids, and accelerated gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis (Figure 21-15).

`Pathophysiology of DKA and HHNKS in diabetes mellitus.`

## Clinical Manifestations
The signs and symptoms of DKA are fairly nonspecific. Polyuria and dehydration result from the osmotic diuresis associated with hyperglycemia. Here the plasma glucose level is higher than the individual’s renal threshold, allowing much glucose to be lost in the urine. Sodium, phosphorus, and magnesium deficits are common. The most important electrolyte disturbance, however, is a marked deficiency in total body potassium. Although the serum potassium may appear normal or elevated because of volume contraction and a shift of potassium out of the cell and into the blood caused by metabolic acidosis, the total body deficiency of potassium may reach 3 to 5 mEq/kg. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include Kussmaul respirations (hyperventilation in an attempt to compensate for the acidosis), postural dizziness, central nervous system depression, ketonuria, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, thirst, and polyuria.
## Evaluation and Treatment
### Evaluation
#### Symptoms 
- vomiting
- abdominal pain
- dehydration
- an acetone odor on the breath
- change in sensorium
#### Labs
Serum glucose of more than 250 mg/dl, a serum bicarbonate of less than 18 mg/dl, a serum pH of less than 7.30, presence of an anion gap, and presence of urine and serum ketones.[176]
### Treatment
Treatment of DKA involves continual administration of low-dose insulin to decrease glucose levels.[60,172] Fluids are administered to replace lost fluid volume, and electrolytes—particularly sodium, potassium, and phosphorus—are administered as needed. Fluids and electrolytes should be monitored closely. Electrolyte deficits become apparent as fluid volume is replaced. After the administration of insulin, the concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate promptly begins to decrease and after a slight increase, acetoacetate also begins to decrease. A persistent ketonuria may be observed for several days after treatment. Continuous monitoring of the individual is essential to ensure an uncomplicated recovery from DKA. Cerebral edema is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality during the first day of treatment for DKA in children. The mechanisms are poorly understood.[177] Health teaching emphasizes predisposing factors and strategies for avoiding DKA.

## Reversing Ketoacidosis

Replacement of fluid volume and insulin interrupts the ketotic cycle and reverses the metabolic acidosis. In the presence of insulin, glucose enters the cells, and the body ceases to convert fats into glucose.

Adequate hydration and insulin replacement usually correct the acidosis, and this treatment is sufficient for many patients with DKA. As shown in Figure 24-3, replacement of bicarbonate is no longer routine except for the severely acidotic patient with a serum pH value lower than 7.0.[24] An indwelling arterial line provides access for hourly sampling of arterial blood gases (ABGs) to evaluate pH, bicarbonate, and other laboratory values in the patient with severe DKA.

Hyperglycemia usually resolves before the ketoacidemia does.[24] Type 1 diabetes patients with DKA can require 6 L of IV fluid replacement even for mild DKA.[25] In one clinical report, patients with previously diagnosed type 1 diabetes in DKA took an average of 21 hours after being started on an IV insulin protocol to clear ketones from the urine. The insulin infusion was continued for 36 hours until the patients could tolerate an oral diet; during this time, the patients received a total of 9.5 L of normal saline for rehydration.[26] Patients who are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes take longer to clear urine ketones and require more insulin to achieve normal glycemic control, compared with long-term diabetics.[26]
