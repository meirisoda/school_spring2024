Related to a deficiency or excess of the hormone _vasopressin_ (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]). Diabetes insipidus occurs with ADH deficiency, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs with ADH excess.

# Diabetes Insipidus
## Pathophysiology

>[!definition]
>**Diabetes insipidus (DI)** is a water metabolism problem caused by an ADH deficiency (either a decrease in ADH synthesis or an inability of the kidneys to respond to ADH). ADH deficiency results in the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Without ADH, distal kidney tubules and collecting ducts do not reabsorb water, leading to **polyuria** (excessive water loss through urination) and dehydration.

Dehydration caused by this massive water loss $\big\uparrow$ plasma osmolarity, increasing thirst. Thirst promotes increased fluid intake and aids in maintaining water homeostasis.

## Pharmacology
### **Desmopressin** (DDAVP, Rhinal Tube, Minirin, Stimate)  
Tablets: 0.1-0.2 mg orally twice daily  
Nasal spray: 10-20 mcg every 8-12 hr  
Parenteral: 1-2 mcg IV or subcutaneously every 12 hr
> The drug is a synthetic type of ADH that serves as a replacement. It binds to kidney receptors and enhances the reabsorption of water, thus reducing urine output.

| Interventions | Rationales |
| ---- | ---- |
| Teach the patient using the inhaled form of the drug to blow the nose before taking the drug. | Drug is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. Nasal secretions can dilute the drug and inhibit its absorption. |
| Teach the patient using the inhaled form to sit upright and hold his or her breath when spraying or using the rhinal tube. | Sitting upright and holding the breath keeps the drug in contact with the nasal mucosa, rather than going down the throat, enhancing drug absorption. |
| Warn the patient not to drink more than 3 L of fluids daily while on this drug. | Drug promotes fluid retention and can lead to fluid overload. |
| Teach the patient to weigh himself or herself daily and to notify the health care provider if 2 lbs or more is gained in 24 hours. | A rapid increase in weight is an indicator of excessive fluid retention and may require a change in drug dosage. |
| Tell the patient to notify the health care provider if he or she experiences a persistent headache or acute confusion. | These are manifestations of water toxicity, which must be treated before seizure activity occurs. |
