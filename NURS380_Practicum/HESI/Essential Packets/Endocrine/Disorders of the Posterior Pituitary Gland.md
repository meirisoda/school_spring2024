Related to a deficiency or excess of the hormone _vasopressin_ (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]). Diabetes insipidus occurs with ADH deficiency, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs with ADH excess.

# Diabetes Insipidus
## Pathophysiology

>[!definition]
>**Diabetes insipidus (DI)** is a water metabolism problem caused by an ADH deficiency (either a decrease in ADH synthesis or an inability of the kidneys to respond to ADH). ADH deficiency results in the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine. Without ADH, distal kidney tubules and collecting ducts do not reabsorb water, leading to **polyuria** (excessive water loss through urination) and dehydration.

Dehydration caused by this massive water loss $\big\uparrow$ plasma osmolarity, increasing thirst. Thirst promotes increased fluid intake and aids in maintaining water homeostasis.
