>The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs when the feedback system that regulates the ADH level fails, causing the pituitary gland to release excessive amounts of ADH.

ADH is generated in the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland. Any disease process that alters the hypothalamic secretion osmoreceptors or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can precipitate SIADH. Thyroid and pituitary lesions, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, oral hypoglycemics, and carbamazepine also can precipitate SIADH. Other associated disorders include abscesses, pneumonia, tuberculosis, hypothyroid disorders, porphyria, and head injury, although the cause may be idiopathic.
## Management
Free water restriction is sufficient in mild cases.[10] Restrictions often start at 800 to 1000 mL/day; however, restrictions as severe as 500 mL/day may be required.
