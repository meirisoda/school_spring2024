Ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, is a common cause for hospital admissions. Although average mortality rates throughout the United States are less than 2%, the highest rates of mortality are observed in older adults and those with other severe underlying illnesses.[172]

>**Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** develops when there is an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. This is most common in individuals with type 1 diabetes but can occur in those with type 2 diabetes as well.[60,172-174] In addition, a syndrome called _ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD)_ has been described in which affected individuals do not fit into the traditional ADA categories for diabetes and are more likely to be persons of African, African American, or Hispanic origin.[175] The most common precipitating factor for DKA is intercurrent illness, such as infection, trauma, surgery, or myocardial infarction. Interruption of insulin administration also may result in DKA. In 20% to 30% of cases, no precipitating factors are noted. Emotional factors and stress, particularly in children, are thought to contribute to the development of DKA. The frequency of DKA peaks in adolescence.

**PATHOPHYSIOLOGY** In a state of relative insulin deficiency there is an increase in insulin counterregulatory hormones including catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, and GH. Catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, and GH antagonize insulin by increasing glucose production. In addition, these hormones decrease use of glucose. Profound insulin deficiency results in decreased glucose uptake, increased fat mobilization with release of fatty acids, and accelerated gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis (Figure 21-15). Relatively increased glucagon levels also contribute to activation of the gluconeogenic (glucose-forming) and ketogenic (ketone-forming) pathways in the liver. Because of the insulin deficiency, hepatic overproduction of β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetic acids causes increased ketone concentrations.[173] Ordinarily ketones are used by tissues as an energy source to regenerate bicarbonate. This balances the loss of bicarbonate, which occurs when the ketone is formed. Hyperketonemia (increased blood ketone levels) may be a result of impairment in the use of ketones by peripheral tissue, which permits strong organic acids to circulate freely. Bicarbonate buffering then does not occur, and the individual develops a metabolic acidosis.

**Pathophysiology of DKA and HHNKS in diabetes mellitus**.

**CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS** The signs and symptoms of DKA are fairly nonspecific. Polyuria and dehydration result from the osmotic diuresis associated with hyperglycemia. Here the plasma glucose level is higher than the individual’s renal threshold, allowing much glucose to be lost in the urine. Sodium, phosphorus, and magnesium deficits are common. The most important electrolyte disturbance, however, is a marked deficiency in total body potassium. Although the serum potassium may appear normal or elevated because of volume contraction and a shift of potassium out of the cell and into the blood caused by metabolic acidosis, the total body deficiency of potassium may reach 3 to 5 mEq/kg. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include Kussmaul respirations (hyperventilation in an attempt to compensate for the acidosis), postural dizziness, central nervous system depression, ketonuria, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, thirst, and polyuria.

**EVALUATION AND TREATMENT** The diagnosis of ketoacidosis is suggested when individuals have symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, an acetone odor on the breath, and change in sensorium. The ADA criteria for diagnosis of DKA include a serum glucose of more than 250 mg/dl, a serum bicarbonate of less than 18 mg/dl, a serum pH of less than 7.30, presence of an anion gap, and presence of urine and serum ketones.[176]

Treatment of DKA involves continual administration of low-dose insulin to decrease glucose levels.[60,172] Fluids are administered to replace lost fluid volume, and electrolytes—particularly sodium, potassium, and phosphorus—are administered as needed. Fluids and electrolytes should be monitored closely. Electrolyte deficits become apparent as fluid volume is replaced. After the administration of insulin, the concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate promptly begins to decrease and after a slight increase, acetoacetate also begins to decrease. A persistent ketonuria may be observed for several days after treatment. Continuous monitoring of the individual is essential to ensure an uncomplicated recovery from DKA. Cerebral edema is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality during the first day of treatment for DKA in children. The mechanisms are poorly understood.[177] Health teaching emphasizes predisposing factors and strategies for avoiding DKA.
