Cardiac catheterization uses contrast and a long, flexible catheter to visualize the heart chambers, coronary arteries, and great vessels. 
It is used to evaluate chest pain, locate the region of coronary artery occlusion, and determine the effects of valvular heart disease. In this invasive procedure, a catheter is inserted into the right femoral or brachial artery to view the left side of the heart and inserted into the antecubital or femoral vein to view structures on the right side of the heart. Cardiac valves, chamber pressures, cardiac output, and the ejection fraction may be assessed using cardiac catheterization. Congenital or acquired structural cardiac abnormalities can be visualized. If a coronary artery is narrowed, a balloon can be used to widen its lumen, or a stent can be placed to permanently keep the vessel open.
