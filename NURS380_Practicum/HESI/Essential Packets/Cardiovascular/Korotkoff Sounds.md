| Phase  | Description  |
|---|---|
|Korotkoff I|The initial presentation of faint but clearly audible tapping sounds, which gradually increase in intensity to a thud or loud tap; the first sound is recorded as the systolic pressure|
|Korotkoff II|Muffled, swishing sounds|
|Korotkoff III|Crisp, loud sounds as the blood flows through an opening artery|
|Korotkoff IV|A distinct, abrupt muffling sound|
|Korotkoff V|The last sound heard before silence—this is the diastolic measurement|
An  auscultatory gap may occur in the latter part of phase I and during phase II. The auscultatory gap is the absence of Korotkoff sounds noted in some patients after the initial systolic pressure; the gap may cover a range as wide as 40 mm Hg. Failure to recognize an auscultatory gap may lead to major errors in measuring blood pressure.
