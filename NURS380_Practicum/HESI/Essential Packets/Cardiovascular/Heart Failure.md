HF or acute pulmonary edema can occur secondary to other conditions that place excessive demands on cardiac output, such as hypertensive crisis, tachycardia due to hyperthyroidism, dysrhythmias, severe anemia, trauma, infection, volume overload (i.e., caused by IV fluids, postoperative fluid shifts), pregnancy, and conditions that affect capillary permeability. In these cases, treatment/correction of the underlying cause is essential and may result in normalization or improvement of cardiac function.
