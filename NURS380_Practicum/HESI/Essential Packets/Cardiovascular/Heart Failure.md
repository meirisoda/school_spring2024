>[!definition]
>_Heart failure_ is a form of cardiac decompensation. Left ventricle failure produces pulmonary congestion, whereas right ventricular failure results in systemic congestion that causes poor perfusion to all organ systems.

HF or acute pulmonary edema can occur secondary to other conditions that place excessive demands on cardiac output, such as hypertensive crisis, tachycardia due to hyperthyroidism, dysrhythmias, severe anemia, trauma, infection, volume overload (i.e., caused by IV fluids, postoperative fluid shifts), pregnancy, and conditions that affect capillary permeability. In these cases, treatment/correction of the underlying cause is essential and may result in normalization or improvement of cardiac function.
## Interventions
- Assess breath sounds and respirations at least q4h. Report presence of crackles (rales) or areas of diminished breath sounds because they _occur as a result of atelectasis caused by decreased depth of respirations (guarding)._
- Assess breathing effort
- Monitor $SpO_{2}$
- Teach effective coughing
