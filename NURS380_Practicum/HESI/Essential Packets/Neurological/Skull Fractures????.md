| Type           | Description                                                                                                | Cause                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Linear**     | Break in continuity of bone without alteration of relationship of parts                         | Low-velocity injuries        |
| **Depressed**  | Inward indentation of skull                                                                     | Powerful blow                |
| **Simple**     | Linear or depressed skull fracture without fragmentation or communicating lacerations           | Low to moderate impact       |
| **Comminuted** | Multiple linear fractures with fragmentation of bone into many pieces                           | Direct, high-momentum impact |
| **Compound**   | Depressed skull fracture and scalp laceration with communicating pathway to intracranial cavity | Severe head injury           |
## Signs and Symptoms
There may be a skull fracture with ecchymosis around the eyes (raccoon eyes), or ecchymosis behind the ear (Battle sign) (Figure 22-3). There may be otorrhea (fluid from the ear), rhinorrhea (fluid from the nose), tinnitus (ringing in the ear) or hearing difficulty, facial paralysis, and conjugate deviation of gaze wherein both eyes deviate to one side. Otorrhea and rhinorrhea should be tested to determine whether there is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Testing with a Dextrostix will determine whether glucose is present; the presence of glucose indicates cerebrospinal fluid. A bleeding into the subarachnoid space may be evidenced by nuchal rigidity (neck pain with flexion).
