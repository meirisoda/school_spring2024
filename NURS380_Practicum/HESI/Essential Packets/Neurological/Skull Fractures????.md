| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Linear**     | Break in continuity of bone without alteration of relationship of parts                         | Low-velocity injuries        |
| **Depressed**  | Inward indentation of skull                                                                     | Powerful blow                |
| **Simple**     | Linear or depressed skull fracture without fragmentation or communicating lacerations           | Low to moderate impact       |
| **Comminuted** | Multiple linear fractures with fragmentation of bone into many pieces                           | Direct, high-momentum impact |
| **Compound**   | Depressed skull fracture and scalp laceration with communicating pathway to intracranial cavity | Severe head injury           |
