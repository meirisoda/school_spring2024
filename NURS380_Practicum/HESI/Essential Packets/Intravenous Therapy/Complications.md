## Infiltration
An **infiltration** occurs when IV fluids leak into the subcutaneous tissue around the venipuncture site because the catheter tip no longer is in the vein. Infiltration causes swelling (from increased interstitial fluid), paleness, and coolness (from decreased circulation) around the venipuncture site. 
### Intervention
Discontinue the infusion and remove the VAD.
Certain IV medications, especially potassium and some antibiotics, cause discomfort and burning sensations at the IV site. Evaluate the source of discomfort, decrease the infusion rate if allowed, or start a new IV line in a larger vein if needed.

Risk factors include acidic or hypertonic IV solutions; rapid IV rate; irritating IV drugs such as KCl and vancomycin; VAD in area of flexion; poorly secured catheter; poor hand hygiene; and lack of aseptic technique.
