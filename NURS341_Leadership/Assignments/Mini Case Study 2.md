### Jamie Lee_Mini Case Study 2
Beverly, a 35-year old full-time nurse on the day shift, has been with your facility for 10 years.  
There are rumors that she comes to work under the influence of alcohol. Staff report the smell of  
alcohol on her breath, unexcused absences from the unit, and an increase in medication errors.  
Although the unit supervisor suspected that Beverly was chemically impaired, she was unable to observe directly any of these behaviors.  
After arriving at work last week, the supervisor walked in to the nurses’ lounges and observed  
Beverly covertly drinking from a dark-colored flask in her locker. She immediately confronted Beverly and asked her is she was drinking alcohol while on duty. Beverly tearfully admitted that she was drinking alcohol but stated this was an isolated incident and begged her to forget it. She promised never to consume alcohol at work again.  
In an effort to reduce the emotionalism of the event and to give herself time to think, the  
supervisor sent Beverly home and scheduled a conference with her for later in the day. At this  
conference, Beverly was defensive and stated, “I do not have a drinking problem, and you are  
overreacting.” The supervisor shared data that she had gathered supporting her impression that Beverly was chemically impaired. Beverly offered no explanation for these behaviors.  
The plan for Beverly was a referral to the State Board of Nursing Diversion Program and a  
requirement that she completes the program as they direct her. Beverly again became very tearful and begged the supervisor to reconsider. She stated that she was the sole provider for her four small children and that her frequent sick days had taken up all available vacation and sick pay. The supervisor stated that she believed her decision was appropriate and again encouraged Beverly to seek guidance for her drinking. Four days later, a colleague of Beverly’s stopped in the supervisor’s office and informed her that Beverly had attempted to commit suicide the day after the meeting.  

Questions:  
In evaluating the problem-solving of the supervisor:  

1. Would your actions have been different if you were the supervisor?  
		To be honest, I don't know how else to act in this situation. While it is clear that 
	
2. Are there conflicting legal and ethical obligations? Explain your answer.
		I do believe there to be conflicting legal and ethical obligations (by a little bit). On a legal standpoint, by drinking on the job, Beverly is putting her patients' lives at risk and legally, I believe I am supposed to report this (depending on state laws).
		On an ethical standpoint, since Beverly is putting her patients' lives and her own life at risk, this should be reported to necessary higher ups. 
	
3. To whom does the manager have the greatest obligation---patients, subordinates, or the  
organization? Why?  
		I believe that, personally, the manager has a great obligation to the patient, As a manage, one is overseeing the care of patients. However, I do also believe that the greatest obligation goes to the organization. The integrity of the organization can be very greatly compromised as a result of Beverly's actions, and if an incident occurs, liability will fall onto the nurse, the manager, and mostly the organization. And as part of administration, the nurse manager is obligated to the organization. 
		
4. Could the outcome have been prevented? Why/why not?  
		I believe the outcome *could* have been prevented, but ultimately it is out of anybody's control except for Beverly. This might sound harsh, but regardless of the amount of support that outsiders provide, in the instance of 
1. Does this outcome reflect on the quality of the problem-solving? Why/why not?
