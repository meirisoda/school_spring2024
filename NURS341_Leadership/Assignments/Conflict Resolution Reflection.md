Conflict Resolution Reflection: 5% - 

After the Conflict Resolution discussion (1/17), students will write a brief, but substantive, reflection on the lecture/discussion to include an applicable clinical practice experience related to the topic of conflict. The reflection will identify an important issue learned during the class, a question that remains unanswered, and how your new knowledge of conflict management may impact your approach to conflict differently in the future. 

Clincial practice experience
Important issue I learned during the class
Question that I still have
How would I differently approach conflict now that I know more conflict management

For me, as I've taken a year off and have had some spaced out clinical experiences, I do not have much to speak on conflicts I've observed *during* my clinicals. However, I can speak of conflicts I've either seen or been directly involved in in a clinical setting. 
A conflict that I have yet to see get resolved was the clash between staff and upper management, specifically regarding favorites. Although it is difficult to say with certainty, as there is only situational evidence, there have been several instances of (possible) favoritism affecting staff holidays, overtime, and scheduling. Some staff would get all of their holiday and time-off requests accepted, while others had to take shifts that were ones they didn't want. There were also times when shift requests were first-come-first-serve, but certain staff members, even when shifts were taken, were able to get those shifts because managment would take the original requester's name off. 


During work, there was a time in which I've clashed with another UAP due to miscommunication. It ended with the UAP yelling at me in the hallway of the unit and required a nurse and the nurse manager to intervene. In comparison to some other conflicts I've seen on units, this wasn't very escalated, however I believe it could have been handled better. Thankfully, the nurse and the manager's invervention prevented any further development or conflict later in the day to arise. In this conflict resolution, I took more of an accommodating conflict management style, as it was a short and acute issue and did not require any further interventions.
