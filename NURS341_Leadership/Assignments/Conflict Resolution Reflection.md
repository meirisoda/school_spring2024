Conflict Resolution Reflection: 5% - 

After the Conflict Resolution discussion (1/17), students will write a brief, but substantive, reflection on the lecture/discussion to include an applicable clinical practice experience related to the topic of conflict. The reflection will identify an important issue learned during the class, a question that remains unanswered, and how your new knowledge of conflict management may impact your approach to conflict differently in the future. 

Clincial practice experience
Important issue I learned during the class
Question that I still have
How would I differently approach conflict now that I know more conflict management

For me, as I've taken a year off and have had some spaced out clinical experiences, I do not have much to speak on conflicts I've observed *during* my clinicals. However, I can speak of conflicts I've either seen or been directly involved in in a clinical setting. 
During work, there was a time in which I've clashed with another UAP due to some mishaps in communication.
