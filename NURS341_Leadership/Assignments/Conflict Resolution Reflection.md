Conflict Resolution Reflection: 5% - 

After the Conflict Resolution discussion (1/17), students will write a brief, but substantive, reflection on the lecture/discussion to include an applicable clinical practice experience related to the topic of conflict. The reflection will identify an important issue learned during the class, a question that remains unanswered, and how your new knowledge of conflict management may impact your approach to conflict differently in the future.
