# Article 1 
It is a general paper that talsk about nursing informatics and how it integrates into our workflow as a crucial component of nursing care over the last decade. And how it benefits us as nurses. 

Nursing informatics can be defined as the application of information technology in nursing responsibilities that encompass management, practice and education. It combines and integrates computer science, nursing science and information to supplement nursing care and help us in our daily tasks. 

And we all know this already, but the usage of nursing informatics is directly correlated with improved patient outcomes. Electronic health record tools (EHRs) allow healthcare providers to access information quickly while allowing them to address patients' needs on time. The utilization of technology has optimized healthcare processes. By reducing time spent on charting, documentation and accessing information, patient satisfaction is also improved.

Besides patient satisfaction, we also have medical duties to fulfill. Patients are here for a reason. And an important aspect of delivering quality patient care and fulfilling our medical duties is in medication administration. 
EHRs play a crucial role in creating a more reliable healthcare system by detecting and preventing errors. 
Quantitative research involving a comprehensive analysis of medication administration and ingestion history was conducted
Findings indicate that medication errors occurred due to a number of reasons: 
- **illegibility of nurse's handwriting**
- **lack of time**
	- helps with saving time as you don't have to spend time shuffling through papers, and the location of data is standardized everywhere. 
- **documentation errors.** 
	- As EHRs typically have a number of standardized data that you must input, which lowers the likelihood of the nurse overlooking things or forgetting to conduct an assessment. 
EHRs reduce the likelihood of these errors by eliminating these factors.  

This ensures that every patient is receiving all the care that they need, and things aren't getting looked over. 

The increasing usage of electronic health records and nursing informatics provide several benefits not only to patients, but also healthcare providers. By enhancing efficiency, reducing medical errors, promoting time management, and enhancing communication, nurses can focus on providing quality care to patients. Implementation according to constantly changing and improving technology will continue to shape the healthcare and nursing environment.
## Concept Map
As I mentioned before, informatics is an application of information technology in the healthcare setting, and it is most easily observed through EHRs. This is also the most directly related to nursing care, as the use of EHRs directly result in positive outcomes such as: reducing time spent on documentation and accessing information, which increases patient satisfaction. It also reduces medication errors caused by the number of factors I listed earlier. 

It optimizes the nursing process and helps us focus on things that are important, like building trust and rapport with our patients and ensuring that they receive quality care. 

Informatics and nursing leadership work hand in hand, because they are the ones who begin the implementation of these tools. The implementations that nursing leadership can do with informatics (and is a part of EHRs) are the Evidence Based Clinical Documentation, and the Nursing Data Portal that Glen talked about earlier in our second paper. These two implementations are crucial parts of our EHRs that we interact with all the time. 

Nursing leadership also develop informatics competencies that drive the adoptions of new technologies for our nurses, and one of the things that help develop these are the TIGER initiative that Eve mentioned earlier. These competencies typically depend on three things, which are informatics knowledge, informatics skills and computer skills.
