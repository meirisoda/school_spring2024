## Article 1 
It is a general paper that talsk about nursing informatics and how it integrates into our workflow as a crucial component of nursing care over the last decade. as nurses, and how it as benefits us. 
Nursing informatics can be defined as the application of information technology in nursing responsibilities encompassing management, practice and education. It combines and integrates computer science, nursing science and information to supplement nursing care.
    
2. The usage of nursing informatics is directly correlated with improved patient outcomes. Electronic health record tools (EHRs) allow healthcare providers to access information quickly while allowing them to address patients' needs on time. The utilization of technology has optimized healthcare processes. By reducing time spent on charting, documentation and accessing information, patient satisfaction is also improved.
    
3. An important aspect of delivering quality patient care is in medication administration. EHRs play a crucial role in creating a more reliable healthcare system by detecting and preventing errors. Quantitative research involving a comprehensive analysis of medication administration and ingestion history was conducted, of which the findings from a quantitative research study analyzing medication administration indicate that medication errors occurred due to a number of reasons: illegibility of nurse's handwriting, lack of time and documentation errors. EHRs reduce the likelihood of these errors by eliminating these factors.
    
4. The increasing usage of electronic health records and nursing informatics provide several benefits not only to patients, but also healthcare providers. By enhancing efficiency, reducing medical errors, promoting time management, and enhancing communication, nurses can focus on providing quality care to patients. Implementation according to constantly changing and improving technology will continue to shape the healthcare and nursing environment.
## Concept Map
As I mentioned before, informatics is an application of information technology in the healthcare setting, and it is most easily observed through EHRs. This is also the most directly related to nursing care, as the use of EHRs directly result in positive outcomes such as: reducing time spent on documentation and accessing information, which increases patient satisfaction. It also reduces medication errors caused by the number of factors I listed earlier. It optimizes the nursing process and helps us focus on things that are important, like building trust and rapport with our patients and ensuring that they receive quality care. 
Informatics and nursing leadership work hand in hand, because they are the ones who begin the implementation of these tools. The implementations that nursing leadership can do with informatics (and is a part of EHRs) are the Evidence Based Clinical Documentation, and the Nursing Data Portal that Glen talked about earlier in our second paper. These two implementations are crucial parts of our EHRs that we interact with all the time. 
Nursing leadership also develop informatics competencies that drive the adoptions of new technologies for our nurses, and one of the things that help drive this is the TIGER initiative that Eve mentioned earlier. These competencies typically depend on three things, which are informatics knowledge, informatics skills and computer skills.

## Nursing Informatics for Leaders in Clinical Nursing

The relationship between nursing informatics competencies and nursing leadership in the improvement of patient care quality. 

### Introduction

Nursing informatics is a relatively young concentration that integrates nursing science with information and analytical sciences to identify, define, manage, and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice. Tangential to these overarching functions, nursing informatics helps inform nursing leaders decisions and create healthcare shifting frameworks to ultimately improve patient care. The utilization and implementation of nursing informatics can be directly observed through HCOs transitioning to EHRs or transitioning between EHRs. Nursing leadership directly influences the development of competencies with informatics related machinery and modalities.

### Literature review (4 Articles)

1. [Impact of Nursing Informatics on the Quality of Patient Care](https://ijmscr.org/index.php/ijmscrs/article/download/196/154) 
    

1. Nursing informatics has made its way as a crucial component of nursing care over the last decade. Nursing informatics can be defined as the application of information technology in nursing responsibilities encompassing management, practice and education. It combines and integrates computer science, nursing science and information to supplement nursing care.
    
2. The usage of nursing informatics is directly correlated with improved patient outcomes. Electronic health record tools (EHRs) allow healthcare providers to access information quickly while allowing to address patients' needs on time. The utilization of technology has optimized healthcare processes. By reducing time spent on charting, documentation and accessing information, patient satisfaction is also improved.
    
3. An important aspect of delivering quality patient care is in medication administration. EHRs play a crucial role in creating a more reliable healthcare system by detecting and preventing errors. Quantitative research involving a comprehensive analysis of medication administration and ingestion history was conducted, of which the findings indicate that medication errors occured due to a number of reasons: illegibility of nurse's handwritings, lack of time and documentation errors. EHRs reduce the likelihood of these errors by eliminating these factors.
    
4. The increasing usage of electronic health records and nursing informatics provide several benefits not only to patients, but also healthcare providers. By enhancing efficiency, reducing medical errors, promoting time management, and enhancing communication, nurses can focus on providing quality care to patients. Implementation according to constantly changing and improving technology will continue to shape the healthcare and nursing environment.
    

3. [A Systems-Level Method for Developing Nursing Informatics Solutions](https://journals.lww.com/jonajournal/fulltext/2019/11000/a_systems_level_method_for_developing_nursing.8.aspx) 
    

1. Nursing leadership plays a critical role in the development of nursing informatics solutions. Data that nursing informatics yields may help illuminate ways to increase productivity, efficiency, performance, effectiveness, cost, and the value of nursing care. Nursing leaders can identify more efficient and effective ways to gather and subsequently utilize this information. 
    
2. This article describes two successful applications of nursing informatics solutions with clearly defined structure and leadership from nursing executives. The framework for both projects was based on: clear lines of responsibility and authority, respect for each type of expertise necessary to the project, and clear commitment to the aim of the project. 
    
3. The framework developed the Evidence-Based Clinical Documentation (EBCD) and Nursing Data Portal (NDP) solutions. The overall vision for the clinically focused EBCD system was to create a patient-centric record that guides and informs the provision of safe, effective, and efficient care by the interdisciplinary team and produces data to valuate care of individual and population care. The leadership-focused NDP system sought to establish a single platform for sharing nursing performance data. 
    
4. These two nursing informatics solutions have different focuses but were developed from the same systems-level framework. This system-level method demonstrates the role of specific leadership in guiding the ideation, design, development, data mapping and visualization, and application of the products. The developed framework gives executive nursing leadership a systems-level method on which to base future projects.

1. Nurse leaders are uniquely positioned to influence the selection, implementation, use, and evaluation of technologies within healthcare settings. However, there are currently no widely adopted standardized competencies that would guide nurse leaders to make informed decisions regarding the acquisition and use of healthcare technologies. This paper looks to 1) identify nurse leader informatics competencies in existing literature 2) What frameworks and theories have been used to develop the competencies 3) What instruments are currently being used to evaluate nurse leader informatics competencies
    
2. Relevant competencies reported: The number of competencies reported varied, ranging from 11 to 304. Some competencies were specific to technology and information systems (ex. Understanding the consequences of workarounds) while others were broader leadership competencies (ex. Workforce development). The most common approach for organizing competencies was placing them into 3 main categories, consisting of: 1) informatics knowledge; 2) informatics skills; and 3) computer skills. Within these categories were 11 identified themes of competencies, including: 1) data/information management; 2) information systems; 3) education; 4) research; 5) ethical/legal/regulatory; (6) privacy/security; 7) impact; 8) requirements/system selection; 9) implementation; 10) analysis/evaluation; and 11) non–informatics-specific competencies.
    
3. Frameworks/Theories/Instruments: In 2001 and 2002 the Information Management Framework identified nursing informatics competencies for nurses at four levels of practice (beginner nurse, experienced nurse, informatics specialist, informatics innovator) with three main categories 1) computer skills 2)informatics knowledge 3) informatics skills. In 2008, these preliminary competencies were combined with the role of nursing leaders identified by the American Organization for Nursing Leadership. Following this, 92 competencies related to computer skills, 40 competencies related to informatics knowledge, and 28 competencies related to informatics skills. One relevant instrument is called the Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment for the Nurse Leader. This instrument measures 1) strategic implementation management; 2) advanced information management and education; 3) executive planning; 4) ethical and legal concepts; 5) information system concepts; and 6) requirements and system selection.
    
4. Nurse leaders are most likely unaware of the gaps that exist in their knowledge and informatics skills. Having a standardized set of nurse leader informatics competencies would allow for the development of appropriately focused and type of resources to be developed. It is critical that nurse leaders play a role in all aspects of decision making surrounding the strategic direction, procurement, selection, implementation, use, and evaluation of such technologies.
    

  
  
  

8. [Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform – TIGER - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6193400/)
    

1. This study's main goal is to empirically define and validate a framework of core competencies in health informatics that are globally accepted. The framework will be guided using information gathered from local educational environments.
    
2. The resulting recommendation framework consists of 24 core competency areas in health informatics defined for five major nursing roles. These areas were clustered in the domains “data, information, knowledge”, “information exchange and information sharing”, “ethical and legal issues”, “systems life cycle management”, “management” and “biostatistics and medical technology”. 
    
3. Nursing Management top 10 Core Competencies: 1) Nursing documentation (including terminologies) 2) Principles of management 3) Strategic management and leadership 4) Quality management 5) Human resource management 6) Change management and stakeholder management 7) Information and Knowledge management 8) Principles of nursing informatics 9) Process management 10) Ethics and IT. This framework acknowledges that it does not give specific recommendations for higher leadership such as chief nursing information officer, but affirms that the framework can be applied to give a rough orientation. 
    
4. The TIGER Initiative is focused on helping the nursing profession to adopt informatics tools, principles, theories, and practices that make healthcare safer and more effective, efficient, patient-centered, and equitable for all stakeholders. TIGER recommended hospital administrators and leadership teams construct a vision that allows nurses and interprofessional colleagues to use informatics and emerging technologies in practice.
