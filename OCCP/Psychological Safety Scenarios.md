## Assignment 
The following three scenarios are examples of situations where the teams lack psychological safety. We would like your team to work through these scenarios to generate ways to address the team's concern and improve their psychological safety.

As you generate a team response for each scenario, please keep in mind Edmondson's three strategies for enhancing psychological safety (references in the assigned video):
- Frame the work. This is a learning problem, not an execution problem.
- Acknowledge your own fallibility. I may miss something, and I need to hear from you.
- Model curiosity. Ask a lot of genuine questions so people feel free to speak up
### Steps for completing this assignment: 
1. Copy and past the scenarios below into a Word document in your team's OneDrive folder.
2. As a team, for each scenarios:
- Define the problem(s)
- Generate potential solutions to the challenges with psychological safety. Your team's response should reflect the perspectives of all of the members in your team. You should incorporate content from Edmondson's strategies (listed above) as well as from the other preparation material.
- For this step, don't divide the scenarios among yourselves and have just one or two people weigh in on each scenario. This "divide and conquer" approach is group work, not interdendent team work. 
4. Once completed, you can submit your team's response by simply designating one member of your team to paste the link to your OneDrive document in this assignment. We will provide feedback in the OneDrive document itself, so do NOT upload the document as a PDF or other file. 
### Suggestion for Efficient and Effective Teamwork in an Online Course
Based on our experience completing online Master's program while working full time and raising a family, we know how hectic it can be to participate in an online course. To help improve our effectiveness and efficiency while maintain the interdependence of teamwork, we strongly recommend you:
- Plan out the following process with assigned roles and interim deadlines early in the first week of the module so everyone knows what is expected of them and when they need to complete the task.
- Identify a team leader for this module. You can rotate team leaders for each module. 
- Identify three people on your team to create the first responses to each scenario. Each person drafts a response to one scenario. Set an interim deadline for these initial drafts. 
- Next, have two different members of the team review and edit each draft. For example, if Person A drafted a response to scenario 1, then they could review the draft for scenario 2. If Person B did not draft an initial response to a scenario, then they could review TWO drafts in this step. This approach should equalize the work among your team members. Set an interim deadline for when the review of the drafts should be completed. 
- Finally, have everyone review and revise all of the responses to the scenarios. This demonstrates interdependence among your team because each person is contributing to each response. Set an interim deadline for when everyone should have read through and edited all of the responses. 
- Finally, in this assignment the team leader can submit the link to the Word document. The final team document is due by February 25 at 11:59 PM.
## Scenario 1
Sam, a new occupational therapist, struggles with speaking up during interprofessional team meetings. He’s new to the profession, so he’s intimidated by the expertise of the clinicians around him. The few times he’s tried, his colleagues have mostly ignored his input while focusing on the more vocal team members. Lately, he feels safer just staying quiet and waiting on instructions from the rest of the group.

At a team meeting, the team discusses plans to discharge Sam’s patient back to his home. The patient is a 24-year-old man who recently lost his left leg in an above-knee amputation after a motorcycle accident and is working with a new prosthetic. Sam has been struggling to safely transfer this patient because of the prosthetic's poor fit and the emotional adjustment his patient has been struggling with. Sam fears discharge will put the patient at risk for injury, but his colleagues all agree that he is medically ready. Sam thinks he must be the only one with concerns, and he’s unsure how to voice them so that his team would pay attention and genuinely listen to his concerns anyway. So he stays quiet.

A week later, Sam’s manager received a report that the patient had been readmitted for falling at home and lacerating his forehead.

> The problem was that Sam feels pressure and the inability to speak up during meetings. He fears voicing his opinions as he doesn't trust them (indicated by his intimidation of his colleagues/seniors). In this situation where his opinions differed from his colleagues, he believed that his judgements were misinformed and stayed quiet. 
> First, Sam must overcome his lack of trust in his own judgements. As he is new to the professional career, he believes that he lacks the experience 

## Scenario 2
A care management team in a local adolescent inpatient behavioral health treatment facility meets daily to review patients for possible discharge. In her role as lead social worker for the unit, Adrian is responsible for presenting a review of patient treatment progress and working with families to plan for discharge and aftercare. She recommends that a 13-year-old patient be discharged the following day as he has met his short-term treatment goals and has demonstrated consistent progress throughout his 10-day admission. The care management team also agrees with the patient's overall readiness to go home.

During the team's discussion regarding aftercare recommendations, the psychiatrist who oversees the unit makes several comments, doubting the patient’s parents' ability to understand and follow through with the aftercare plan despite never meeting them or anyone else on the team discussing this as a concern. He recommends that child protective services (CPS) become involved with the family to monitor the family’s compliance with treatment recommendations post-discharge, despite no history of concerns regarding the patient’s safety. Others on the team begin to nod their heads in agreement. Adrian is shocked by this recommendation and disagrees that a call to CPS is warranted. She is concerned about disagreeing with the psychiatrist and others on the team who also seem to agree. She begins to question her judgment and wonders if she has missed something. Adrian decides not to voice her concerns regarding potential unnecessary CPS involvement during the meeting. Several other team members approached her later in the day to indicate they disagreed with the psychiatrist's recommendation, but no one said anything during the meeting.

## Scenario 3
On her first day as a pharmacist, Marta received a detailed script on how to educate patients to use an inhaler. She follows it for her first few patients, but it seems forced and unnatural, and she doesn’t feel like she’s connecting with her patients. So, she makes some edits to the education plan, which evolves into more of an informal conversation where patients lead the discussion. Marta wants to ask her manager if she can use this approach in an upcoming team huddle. But what if the manager denies her request? Or even worse, what if they permit her, but she misses key information, and patients use the inhalers ineffectively? Surely, her manager will never again take her ideas seriously.

So, she sticks with the usual format, which falls flat. The patients don’t ask many questions, and she walks away feeling like they didn’t learn much. Meanwhile, many of her co-workers also report a lack of patient engagement.
